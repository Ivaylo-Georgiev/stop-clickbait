# üé£ STOP CLICKBAIT

## Overview
‚ÄúStop Clickbait‚Äù is web app that reveals the content behind clickbait news titles. The goal is never to spoil content or maliciously strip away ad revenue but rather to illustrate that headlines and titles that respect a reader‚Äôs digital autonomy are a better way to generate clicks. Readers who have a high enough interest in headlines written with integrity are more likely to click on advertisers featured on the click through pages.

## Features
### Detect Clickbait
To detect a clickbait, a user need not to be logged in or have an account. They should only enter a title of an article and then, based on artificial intelligence the system determines, whether it is a clickbait or not. This happens via a Naive Bayes classifier. The datasets, used for the classification contain of 16 000 clickbait and non-clickbait article titles. The source of the datasets can be found [here](https://github.com/bhargaviparanjape/clickbait/tree/master/dataset). To improve the accuracy of the algorithm, stopwords (e.g. 'a', 'the', etc.) need to be ignored for the classification. Since the precise definition of a stopword can be ambiguous, a list of stopwords in English is taken from the website [ranks.nl](https://www.ranks.nl/stopwords)
